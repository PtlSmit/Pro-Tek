        <h1>SMit Patel</h1>
        <p>I have completed my Master 
            in Computer Science. After that
            i have worked for Legion as Account
            Director. Also, I switch over to 
            Engineer Associated and worked as District
            Manager for 2 years. Now, I am thinking
             to Switch over my Career to UI Developer.
             I had a good knowledge of HTML and CSS
             but as staying away from tech industry it needs
             little brush on skills. So, I have selected 
                Pro-Tek.
